Suggestions for future
-----------

* ToC has some extra list disks on some pages because of some odd headline hiearchy.

* Avoid scrolling to top on window.location.reload() in Chrome;
* Consider moving cannonical-tags to > Hugo taxonomies and in general use Hugo taxonomies for "indexing content". Also see Hugo's Related Content feature.
* Use Hugo leaf bundles for tutorials; shared resources (YAML files, images) between languages, simpler maintainance etc.
* Redirects from aliases
* A strategy for translations of UI vs content
* Archetypes. Also see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4535 for a directory based approach.
* CSS chroma.
